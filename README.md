# PID-Precision_Motor_Control 
This project involoves an anti-windup PID algorithm to precisely regulate motor speed & position where the position and angle of this smart spin motor can be visually determined from blinking LED & reading from LCD The arduino code is also uploaded here.

Simulations
The tinkercad Simulations have ben attached as a separarte file
In Simulation results we can see that on providing certain spikes (interruption in rotation of motor using debounce button) PID controller bring the speed to th Preset value from Pulse Width Modulator.
